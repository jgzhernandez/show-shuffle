## Project idea/ Problem
The project idea was inspired by my boredom. When there are times during my leisure when I have nothing to do, I opt to relax by watching shows on netflix, disney+, etc. However, I tend to be indecisive with what I want to watch since there are so many choices out there. Which is why I came up with an idea to create a random picker for shows. Using the OMDb api(https://www.omdbapi.com/), I created a random movie picker which will also allow the user to save the random movies picked to their favorites list. The app still has a lot of room for improvement, such as generating links to where the picked show can be watched, fetching reviews from other people, optimizing the random ID generator, etc., which I look forward to building in the future.
